## Product Backlog Principles

The backlog is prioritized according to the value that each functionality provides to the main objective of Traduce Señas.

The core translation functionality has the highest priority because it directly addresses the communication problem identified during product definition.

Features that support the main translation flow, such as authentication and camera access, are also prioritized before secondary functionality such as history, administration, and model improvement.
