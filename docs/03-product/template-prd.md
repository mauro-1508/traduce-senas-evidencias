# Product Requirements Document — Traduce Señas

## 1. Product Overview

### Product Name

**Traduce Señas**

### Product Type

Mobile application for sign language recognition and translation.

### Product Summary

Traduce Señas is a mobile application designed to facilitate communication between deaf or hard-of-hearing people and hearing people who do not know sign language.

The application uses the device's camera to recognize supported signs and translate them into text or audio in real time.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Deaf or hard-of-hearing people may experience communication barriers when interacting with hearing people who do not know sign language.

The limited availability of professional interpreters and the lack of general knowledge of sign language can make communication difficult in everyday situations, educational institutions, workplaces, healthcare services, public institutions, and commercial establishments.

Traduce Señas aims to provide an accessible technological alternative that can help reduce these communication barriers.

---

## 3. Product Vision

For deaf and hard-of-hearing people who need to communicate with hearing people who do not know sign language, **Traduce Señas** is a mobile sign language translation application that recognizes signs through the device's camera and translates them into text or audio in real time.

Unlike relying exclusively on professional interpreters or alternative communication methods, the product provides an accessible technological alternative designed to facilitate communication in everyday situations.

## 9. AI and Translation Requirements

The core translation functionality depends on a computer vision and machine learning process.

The general process is:

1. The user activates the camera.
2. The application captures movement.
3. Relevant landmark information is extracted.
4. The data is prepared for inference.
5. TensorFlow.js processes the information using the recognition model.
6. The model generates a prediction.
7. The application converts the prediction into a sign translation.
8. The result is displayed as text and can be reproduced as audio.
9. Relevant information may be registered for history or analysis.

The recognition model will initially support only the signs available in the validated dataset.
